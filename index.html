    <p>To celebrate FUWAMOCO reaching 1 million Ruffians subscribed to their YouTube channel, we are making a fanbook!
    </p>
    <p>It will be both a printable collection of messages and images to send to them, as well as a website to
        interactively show off everything in the printable fanbook as well as any audio, video, or other digital media
        that can&#39;t be printed.</p>
